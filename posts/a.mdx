<Collapsible summary={<em>Want to create your own Figma plugin?</em>}>

  I've used [Figsvelte](https://github.com/thomas-lowry/figsvelte) as a boilerplate for this project and can also recommend it to you. [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) compiles down to just pure JS so there's no overhead compared to virtual DOM solutions like React or Vue. Coupled with [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org/guide/en/) you have an ecosystem of plugins at your hand (e.g. TypeScript, cssnano, etc.) that can further improve the compiled JS. Lastly, the boilerplate uses [figma-plugin-ds-svelte](https://github.com/thomas-lowry/figma-plugin-ds-svelte) which is a UI library that mimics Figma's own design.

  So if you know Svelte already, go ahead and clone the boilerplate. If not, I'd encourage you do try Svelte anyways since it's an exiting technology!
